# topScorer(data) [10 Points]
# Write the function topScorer(data) that takes a multi-line 
# string encoding scores as csv data for some kind of 
# competition with players receiving scores, so each 
# line has comma-separated values. The first value on 
# each line is the name of the player (which you can 
# assume has no integers in it), and each value after 
# that is an individual score (which you can assume is a 
# non-negative integer). You should add all the scores 
# for that player, and then return the player with the 
# highest total score. If there is a tie, return all the 
# tied players in a comma-separated string with the names 
# in the same order they appeared in the original data. 
# If nobody wins (there is no data), return None (not the 
# string "None"). So, for example:

def topScorer(data):
    # Your code goes here...
    lis = data.splitlines()
    print(lis)
    s = ""
    for i in range(len(lis)):
        sum = 0
        l = lis[i].split(",")
        prev =0
        for j in range(1, len(l)):
            sum+=lis[i]
            temp = l[j][0]
        
        if sum > prev:
            prev = sum
        elif sum == prev:
            s = "," + temp
    return ""
