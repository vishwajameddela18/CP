# sAdditivePrime: Additive primes can be defined as prime numbers where the sum of its digits is a prime number. Write a function isAdditivePrime that takes n as an integer and returns True if n is an Additive Prime and False otherwise.
# Some of the Additive Primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 23, 29, and etc.
# 29 = 2 + 9 = 11 = 1 + 1 = 2 and 2 is a prime number.
# Here are sample test cases:
# assert (isAdditivePrime(2) == True)
# assert (isAdditivePrime(3) == True)
# assert (isAdditivePrime(5) == True)
# assert (isAdditivePrime(13) == False)
# assert (isAdditivePrime(23) == True)
# assert (isAdditivePrime(29) == True)
# assert (isAdditivePrime(41) == True)
# assert (isAdditivePrime(98) == False)
# assert (isAdditivePrime(198) == False)
# assert (isAdditivePrime(290) == False)
# assert (isAdditivePrime(67) == True)
# assert (isAdditivePrime(97) == False)
# print("All test cases passed... :-)")
